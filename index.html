        <h1>The Journey to Honduras</h1>
	    <p>This was my first trip to Honduras and it was a cruise from Miami. This cruise had couples from all over the country, celebrating marriages. As the cruise ship left the port in Dade County, Miami, we were able to talk on our cell phones and text until we were about 10 miles from the port. Our dependency on cell phones was hard to put away, so we purchase a data plan that the cruise line offered ðŸ¤“ </p>

        <h3>Leaving Miami and Arriving at Honduras</h3>
	    <p>As the cruise ship headed south west to over 750 + miles to our destination, we finally arrive after a day of travel and observing all the ocean one's eyes can see. We had no excursion to go on after we departed the ship, so we took a local cab for a tour of the country with a couple from Texas. While the taxi was taking off, an unexpected guest climbs in through the hatch back. He spoke English, so now we have our own interpreter who's talking with the driver now.</p>

        <h3>First-Stop</h3>
        <p>Our first stop is a self-made local zoo. They had very beautiful and colorful parrots and monkeys that jumped on you for food. Rabbits that have no tails and iguanas walking around or just being still waiting to prey on an animal.</p>

        <h3>Second-Stop</h3>
        <p>The second stop was a small beach. Before we got there, we toured the neighborhood and observed the houses and the people in their own habitat. Life is simple and relaxing and the weather was excellent. The water was turquoise blue and people were enjoying the moment. We met Americans who relocated there and some have rental property near the beach. We can also see a major airlines flying in on the other side of the beach a few miles away.</p>

        <h3>Third-Stop</h3>
	    <p>Our third stop was for food. We enjoyed some of the local dishes near the beach. It was very good, fresh and locally grown. They had cashew trees nearby. We tried the apple as it is the fruit of the cashew. It was very tart, and is very high in Vitamin C. The nut is covered in a dark substance that's not edible. Our guide said they cook the nut to burn off the poisonous substance.</p>
